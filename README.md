# My C++ Utility Libraries

A set of **C++ utility libraries** for faster development and reuse.  
These libraries include:

- **Math Utilities** – basic math functions, factorial, prime checks, palindrome, rounding, square root, etc.
- **Random Utilities** – random numbers, characters, words, passwords, dice rolls, keys
- **Input/Output Utilities** – reading numbers, characters, menus, yes/no input, colored console output
- **Array Utilities** – read, print, shuffle, copy, sum, average, odd/even/positive/negative count, palindrome check, and more

## How to Use

1. Place all header files (`.h`) in a single folder in your project (e.g., `include/`).  
2. Include the master header `MyUtilities.h` to access all libraries:

```cpp
#include "MyUtilities.h"
